This is a sample of how to use the MQTT V3.1 protocol with a rexx program.  It was written using Regina REXX with an add-on Rxsock library.

It should work with ooRexx (with the built in REXX sockets) but I've not tried it.

It has been tested (but not exhaustively) with Mosquitto.

On Ubuntu you'll need Regina and the development library (`apt-get install regina-rexx libregina3-dev`). Regina doesn't include a RxSock package so you'll need to install that package from http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/rxsock/rxsock/1.4/RxSock-1.4.tar.gz (sorry it isn't available ready built).
